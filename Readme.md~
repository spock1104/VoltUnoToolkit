#  VoltUnoToolkit

This toolkit was built for the specific purpose of building the Volt Uno kernel based off of ZV5 for the LG Volt. 

Read the included instructions to prepare your build.

This should also work for DeCAF Cyanogenmod 11 built by me. The boot.img you unpack to get the ramdisk and split_img folders will have to be from the rom zip provided, but soon there will be no need for that as I will integrate Volt Uno into the DeCAF CM11 rom.

Should work for any other kernel
