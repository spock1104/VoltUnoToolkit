Note: since i rushed this out, it doesnt yet build a full boot.img or build modules. Since we are building a stock kernel, we dont really need to worry about modules since users will already have the correct ones we want in their /system/lib/modules directory. In case you want to build custom modules, I cant help you with that right now. Ill fix this in the future, but for now the following is how it goes.

1) download zv5 source from my github @ https://github.com/touchpro/android_kernel_lge_voltuno, unpack it to kernel folder

2) download the linaro 4.9.3 (or whichever linaro prebuilt toochain you want) from here http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2098133 and unpack it to linaro4.9.3 folder

3) download AIK-Linux from xda @ http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2073775

4) unpack AIK-Linux to AIK-Linux folder

5) if running the toolkit for the first time, run ". unpackstockboot.sh" to unpack the stock boot image

5.5) MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS! ~/voltunotoolkit/kernel/Makefile: line 196: change /home/jesse/ to /home/whateveryourusernameis/
The reason for this is the compiler doesnt like the ~/ home folder designation. Its a pain in the nuts but oh well. Ill fix it in the future with a variable that uses pwd.

6) run ". build.sh" without the quotes to get voltunov2.img in main directory

7) At this point, you should test it before you release it. Reboot to fastboot by pulling your battery or power down in android. To do so in case you forgot, hold volume up and plug usb into computer. 

8) enter the following in terminal to test boot:

fastboot boot image-new_bumped.img

or

fastboot flash boot image-new_bumped.img 

to flash it over your boot partition once you have tested it and know things are ok.

9) Thats it, release it on android-forums and make sure you upload your changes to the kernel to github according to gplv2.
