Note: since i rushed this out, it doesnt yet build a full boot.img or build modules. Since we are building a stock kernel, we dont really need to worry about modules since users will already have the correct ones we want in their /system/lib/modules directory. In case you want to build custom modules, I cant help you with that right now. Ill fix this in the future, but for now the following is how it goes.

1) download zv5 source from my github @ https://github.com/touchpro/android_kernel_lge_x5zv5

2) unzip it to kernel folder

3) download AIK-Linux from xda @ http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2073775

4) unpack AIK-Linux to AIK-Linux folder

5) if running the toolkit for the first time, run ". unpackstockboot.sh" to unpack the stock boot image

6) run ". build.sh" without the quotes to get voltunov2.img in main directory

7) At this point, you should test it before you release it. Reboot to fastboot by pulling your battery or power down in android. To do so in case you forgot, hold volume up and plug usb into computer. 

8) enter the following in terminal to test boot:

fastboot boot image-new_bumped.img

or

fastboot flash boot image-new_bumped.img 

to flash it over your boot partition once you have tested it and know things are ok.

9) Thats it, release it on android-forums and make sure you upload your changes to the kernel to github according to gplv2.

Note: To replace toolchain, delete the contents of toolchain folder. Replace with contents of desired toolchain. The default right now is google's gcc 4.7 from cyanogenmod sources.
