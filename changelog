any suggestions you guys may have

You can use trickstermod or Faux clock from market to turn off mpdecision and use intelliplug instead. Intelliplug will let you use all 4 cores at the same speed at once, reducing battery life at the cost of super quick response with Intellidemand.

To get around the whole adb remount and adb as root issue right now, go on xda and look for "Adbd Insecure" or be awesome and support a hell of a dev by buying it from chainfire in the market. (no affiliation with any program or developer mentioned, just recognize how much all of them have done for our devices)

I decided against disabling or setting SELinux to permissive. It works fine just how it is, and nothing this kernel does needs it. If you want to set SELinux to permissive, there are apps in the market or you can use adb:

su setenforce 0
getenforce (should say permissive)
